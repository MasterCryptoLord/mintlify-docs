title: "Staking"

The BlastFi Terminal is set to redefine user engagement and investment strategies through its innovative approach to staking
and unstaking, offering a tailored experience that aligns with various user preferences and financial goals. By introducing
two primary staking options – flexible and locked staking – BlastFi Terminal addresses the diverse needs of its user base,
from those seeking stability to those pursuing higher rewards.

## Flexible Staking:

Flexible staking is designed for users who prefer liquidity and the ability to access their assets without committing to a
fixed term. This option is ideal for individuals who wish to earn rewards on their holdings but are not ready to lock in their
assets for an extended period. It provides a balanced approach, offering competitive yields while retaining the flexibility to
unstake at short notice, catering to users with a cautious investment strategy or those who prefer to stay agile in a rapidly
changing market.

## Locked Staking:

On the other end of the spectrum, locked staking appeals to users looking for higher yield opportunities and are comfortable
with committing their assets for a predetermined period. By opting for locked staking, users can take advantage of various
yield enhancements and experience points (XP) rewards, which can amplify their earnings and contribute to a more rewarding
investment journey. This option is tailored for users who are willing to embrace a longer-term view, trading immediate
liquidity for potentially greater returns and benefits.

## Future Features – Native Yield Staking:

Looking ahead, BlastFi Terminal plans to introduce Native Yield Staking, a feature that promises to further enrich the staking
landscape. Specifically, by locking Ethereum (ETH) for a year, users can participate in a unique staking model designed to
minimize volatility. In this model, the value of a user's stake is converted into a score, which is then matched in BLASTFI
tokens. The incorporation of a 2x score multiplier magnifies the impact of this staking method, directing all returns towards
the strategic buyback and burn of $BLASTFI tokens. This mechanism not only enhances the token's value through scarcity
but also aligns with the platform's long-term vision of creating a robust and sustainable ecosystem.

This innovative feature, scheduled for release following the platform's initial launch, signifies BlastFi Terminal's commitment
to continuous improvement and the introduction of mechanisms that benefit its users and the platform's overall health.
By offering a low-volatility staking path that rewards users and supports the $BLASTFI token's market dynamics,
BlastFi Terminal is poised to offer a compelling and comprehensive staking environment that caters to a broad
range of investment styles and objectives.
