## NFT Viewer and Leaderboard

Integration of an NFT viewer within the dashboard, and a leaderboard consisting of 2 components, score from staking/locking + bonus score from events (like weekly check-in, booster events, etc)

## native YIELD staking

Get ready for a game-changing opportunity with YIELD staking, launching soon!
Lock your ETH for a year and dive into a "low-volatility" adventure, where your stake's value transforms into a powerful score, matched dollar for dollar in BLASTFI.
With a 2x score multiplier, we're channeling all returns into a strategic buyback and burn of BLASTFI.

## Weekly Bonus Program

A retention strategy where users can claim a set amount of tokens weekly for active participation. The grant size increases with the number of users invited to the platform.
