### 🔥 10% Buyback and Burn:

We're not just stopping at revenue share – Zaibot is committed to the sustained growth of $ZAI. We will
buy back and burn 10% of ZAI tokens with the ETH collected. This strategic move ensures a continuously
diminishing supply, fostering scarcity and potential value appreciation for all token holders.

### 🌐 10% Strategic Allocations:

10% is allocated for development, team, CEX expansions, Giveaways & Future
Airdrops.
