## Locked Staking: Stability and Reward

Locked Staking emerges as a cornerstone of our platform, offering participants the chance to enjoy enhanced revenue sharing rewards. By committing your tokens to a locked staking arrangement, you not only contribute to the stability and security of the network but also unlock a tiered reward system. The principle behind locked staking is simple yet profoundly impactful: the more you stake, the longer your time window for rewards will be extended. This approach incentivizes long-term investment and engagement within the zaiBot ecosystem, rewarding users for their loyalty and support with increasing benefits over time.

## Flash Staking: Immediate High Yields

On the other hand, Flash Staking introduces a dynamic, high-energy investment option for those seeking immediate, high-yield returns. Characterized by its short duration, flash staking offers users a limited time window to participate in each staking session. The allure of flash staking lies in its spontaneity and the potential for significant returns in a condensed period. Sessions can be launched at any moment, providing an adrenaline-fueled staking experience that demands attentiveness and readiness to act swiftly. This staking type appeals to users who thrive on rapid market movements and are looking for quick gains.
