## Locked Staking: Stability and Reward

Locked Staking emerges as a cornerstone of our platform, offering participants the chance to enjoy enhanced
revenue sharing rewards. By committing your tokens to a locked staking arrangement, participants not only
contribute to the stability and security of the network but also unlock a tiered reward system based on the
duration of the stake. Specifically, tokens can be locked for periods of 3, 6, or 12 months, with longer
locking periods yielding higher points and an increased share of the revenue. This graduated reward structure
is designed to incentivize long-term investment and sustained engagement within the zaiBot ecosystem, rewarding
users for their loyalty and support with progressively greater benefits over time.

## Flash Staking: Immediate High Yields

On the other hand, Flash Staking introduces a dynamic, high-energy investment option for those seeking immediate,
high-yield returns. Characterized by its short duration, flash staking offers users a limited time window to
participate in each staking session. The allure of flash staking lies in its spontaneity and the potential for
significant returns in a condensed period. Sessions can be launched at any moment, providing an adrenaline-fueled
staking experience that demands attentiveness and readiness to act swiftly. This staking type appeals to users
who thrive on rapid market movements and are looking for quick gains.
