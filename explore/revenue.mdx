This section delves into the specifics of a revenue sharing model utilized in token-based platforms, focusing on the incentives for active participation and the benefits derived from a referral program.

## Short-term Participation with High Rewards

### Direct Revenue Sharing

Users actively participating or investing on the platform receive a portion of the generated revenue. This incentivizes short-term engagement by offering high rewards, based on their activity level, investment amount, or held tokens.

### No Dilution Across Inactive Tokens

Rewards are not diluted by inactive tokens, ensuring that active participants receive a concentrated share of the rewards. This policy encourages users to maintain active engagement with the platform.

## Benefits and Staking Time Extension Through Referral Program

### Referral Program

The platform offers a referral program to extend benefits and staking times. Users who refer others to join the platform can enjoy additional hours and rewards, promoting the growth of an active user base.

### Additional Hours and Rewards

More referrals translate to more rewards for the referrer, such as extended staking durations or increased revenue shares. This system motivates users to actively promote the platform and contribute to its growth.

## Overall Impact

### Enhanced User Engagement

The combination of high rewards for short-term participation and referral incentives ensures high user engagement. This leads to a more vibrant ecosystem with increased transactions and liquidity.

### Sustainable Growth

The model supports sustainable growth by attracting users interested in immediate gains and long-term platform success. It encourages active promotion and participation, fostering a thriving community.

### Community Building

By aligning the platform's success with user benefits, this model cultivates a strong sense of community. It incentivizes users to support each other and the platform, creating a mutually beneficial ecosystem.
