The dynamic leaderboard, a platform element intended to encourage and reward active involvement, is at the center of the Zaibot Terminal's user engagement strategy. By participating in different activities on the platform, like staking, finishing challenges, and successfully referring others, users are encouraged to go up the ranks. There are multiple tiers to the leaderboard, and each tier offers increasingly lucrative awards and allocations. Because of the tiered system, users with varying skill levels have something to aim for, making the ascent up the leaderboard both difficult and satisfying.

Friend recommendations are critical to moving up the rankings. By referring friends to the platform, users can receive a percentage of the XP earned by their referrals, resulting in a mutually advantageous system that benefits both the referrer and the recommended. This method not only speeds up a user's advancement up the leaderboard, but it also encourages the expansion of the Zaibot community, making the platform more alive and exciting.
